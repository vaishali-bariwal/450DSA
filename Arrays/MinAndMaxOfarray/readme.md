Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
Output:
min = 1, max =  10000

 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
Output:
min = 1, max = 56789

 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <=1012
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
Output:
0 0 1
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.


Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort012() that takes an array arr and N as input parameters and sorts the array in-place.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 2
